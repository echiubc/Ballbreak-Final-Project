Game Demo: https://youtu.be/-K6EEuqjHN4


Controls:
-	Left arrow key.
-	Right arrow key.
-	Hit the ball while moving the paddle to manipulate the ball’s horizontal velocity.

Difficulty Levels:
-	Easy: 0.67x speed – paddle 1.36x width
-	Normal
-	Hard: 1.33x speed – paddle 0.72x width
-	Impossible: 1.67x speed – paddle 0.56x width

Game Rules:
-	The wall starts with 5 columns. After each wall is broken, another column is added. (4 columns  5 columns  6 columns etc.)
-	For each wall broken, points are given (1st wall = 50 points; 2nd wall = 100 points; 3rd wall = 150 points; etc.)
-	When the score is divisible by 30, the ball is in an explosive form. The ball will be able to damage multiple blocks.
-	The ball will NOT reset location after each wall is broken. It is possible for an entire wall to be broken without player input.

-	Playing on Easy difficulty halves the final score.
-	Playing on Hard difficulty doubles the final score.
-	Playing on Impossible difficulty quadruples the final score.
